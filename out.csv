Mom - Cammp

Smell - the smell was also a mystery scent of a what is almost a skunky sourness. Its definitely got some really unique terpenes, they¬† aren't overly loud at first but as soon as you bust it up, you can really smell it's true potential 

Smoke - the transition to smoke was another odd turn on the flavor scale. It had an almost herbal fruitiness to it on the inhale which then moved back to the sour skunk with some earthiness on the exhale. Light grey ash, with the smoke being smooth and resin ring fully aboard

High - a great hybrid that definitely gives you a nice intake of both worlds. With its sativa dominance it is uplifting and a true motivator, and there is next to no burnout. This is a strain that can be smoked on at any time of day with no stopping or slowing down on your tasks. 

Quality: 9/10 almost all medium sized buds with a couple smaller nugs, crispy exterior with a sticky interior that really fluffed up when busted. Medium green coloring, with bright fire orange pistils, and all dusted in trichomes",1604376691,https://i.redd.it/w5h8j9i3ayw51.jpg

DCM has the kind of smell that will wake everyone up in a 100m radius if you're not careful. Taste/smell is doughty, gassy and LOUD. Don't smoke this during the day if you want to be productive.

Visual: What a beautiful bud! There were lots of different colours like some light greens some bright greens some dark greens and some different purples as well. It was very pretty. There was lots of sparkly crystal all over and it had a nice structure to it. There was some fox tailing coming off the long x-mas tree shaped bud. It was crazy dense. 

Nose: There was an earthy and fruity smell that was a bit like candy and there was also a bit of a creamy vanilla to it.

Cut/Roll/Grind: It was very easy to cut and to grind. There were some really cool vibrant purples when I ground it up. It squishes a bit when I cut it up with scissors and it was a bit sticky.  

Taste: The taste was sweet and earthy with some pine and some gas that I did not get in the smell. 

Burn: It burnt was pretty good. The ash was a little bit salt and peppery.

Potency/Effects: Wow! This one had Amazing visuals and the potency was very good. It was a very relaxing body-based buzz that chilled out my body. It still had some mind awareness effects so it would be good for sitting and doing something creative. It felt like it had good medicinal effects as well. Very nice!

Overall score ‚Äì 9.5/10

The DB itself is great. More pine than gas. More indica leaning as it doesn't knock me out but gives great sedating effects. Buds aren't leafy like some have noted. Nicely sized throughout and dense. Smoke is tasty and fairly smooth. Was able to get this on sale it was good value. Q9 V9",1604359573,https://imgur.com/dwoe9p3

Another awesome pink from loud clouds!
Definately a beauty! On the darker side some leaves are almost black.. really nice stuff.. plenty of visible heads too.. 

Got a nice stick to it but not overly.. the pink uni is much more.. this cure is really nice! I'm able to take nice huge tokes from the bong with minimal cough.. very smooth.. taste just like those other pinks lol.. nice and sweet.. not too strong though I wish it was a little more dank on the smell and stickyness.. 

Buzz is ok.. not that strong.. I could smoke a good amount of this and not have to tap out after like 4 or 5 bongs... I coulda kept going lol.. make sure your snacks are nearby haha.. 

Overall pretty nice stuff . Could use a little improvement for this strain.. I ask about info on these strains but seems like they know just as much as I know.. I'd like to know the crosses of these strains I'm getting from LoudClouds cause their pretty awesome.. like to know how their grown too.. if their all the same grower or all organic or living soil or what... I've yet to be disappointed by loud clouds! Highly recommend these guys!

Side note... Idk if this is for everyone cause I have been getting from them for a while.. but I only paid 10 bucks for fed ex overnight delivery... Came the next day!",1604371436,/r/MOMpics/comments/jn2adm/kings_pink_from_loud_clouds_nov_2nd/
jmxm64,FuseEleven,,,DINO WIZARD - WEED POSTERS - OCT 2020,"This is the type of strain you buy if you have no budget or want to treat yourself. The nugs were all medium/large. I‚Äôve never smelled a strain that was so gassy but sweet at the same time. Reminded me of sweet burning rubber. The smoke in a joint was very flavourful, flavour through the whole joint. Took a few bong rips out of a dirty bong and was surprised to till find flavour on the exhale. 

I would buy this strain again without hesitation. Best smoke of the year and top 5 of my life.

jn2t2e,DPearcey,,,Tyson - TheSmokingMonkeys - Oct 2020,"These nugs had a dark Forrest green appearance with dark orange almost amber pistils and a fair coating of trichomes. The density of these nugs were almost rock hard with only a few sugar leaves left on them. The cure seemed pretty spot on with this.

The aroma I got from this bud was a pungent diesel and gassy smell with some earthiness I would say. The taste translated quite well with that kushy, diesel and earthiness and a bit a spice that went together for a nice flavour. This stuff burned with a grey ash.

This high started out pretty chill leaving me happy and almost uplifted for a pure Indica that soon turned into a solid body high leaving me completely relaxed and pain free. I found this is a great strain if you‚Äôre planning on just chilling.",1604373450,https://i.redd.it/slxrrzcg0yw51.jpg

jn1yx4,thechronickid_00,,,Gelato 33 - Sourced by Karplusan Forest - October 2020,"More pics - https://imgur.com/a/IWnTekt

If I'm starting to sound like a broken record by now it's because I definitely am when it comes to Gelato or in this case Gelato 33. One of my top strains of all time and always a welcomed treat. This particular batch has a delightful bag appeal, showcasing a combination of dark greens and gentle purples that really emphasise the vibrant clusters of orange pistils and layer of crystals. The buds are firm and have a decent Ievel of moisture to them, grinding up to a consistency that sits comfortably between sticky and dry. Very neatly trimmed as well.

The profile is super familiar yet always pleasant and enjoyable. Sweet, dessert like aromas that are of the creamy, doughy variety with just a touch of citrus. Absolutely delicious. It was slightly different when smoked as the sweet gelato terps were met with a sharp earthy dankness but it was more noticeable in a bong. Very thick and hard hitting smoke, delivering a potent punch to the lungs while burning to a clean white ash. Greases up nice and quick in a joint, leaving a thick resin ring behind.

Literally the perfect hybrid in my opinion. It borrows those redeeming qualities that make sativas and indicas special and combines them to create an uplifting, euphoric, social driven high with enough of a mellow, relaxed vibe to feel super comfortable and easygoing the entire time. A great daytime/afternoon strain to have around at all times whether it be inside gaming or hanging with friends. It's not necessarily sedating but smoking enough during the day can leave one in a lazy slumber.",1604370246,https://i.redd.it/w2clmkexqxw51.jpg

Originally wasn‚Äôt interested at the price point but got a free gram sample in my last order and trying that lead me to buying this half at 160 including shipping with a coupon, still expensive but as a one time treat you can‚Äôt go wrong.

Got some huge chunky sized nugs mixed with mediums in the half, it grinds up so fine and purple/dark that it looks like something a dinosaur would smoke lol 

Burns white ash, and it is strong, I have high tolerance but feeling this one right away after a joint. Interesting taste can‚Äôt really describe now but smooth thick ash. This will probably be a one time but but good stuff thought I‚Äôd be disappointed at the price but it lives up to it.
