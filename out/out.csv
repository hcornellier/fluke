t3_jg5tb5,/u/PrettyDopeKits,Blue Magoo Cookies - Kootenay Botanicals - Late OCT,"Looks- 8/10 super fluffy and Sticky nugs, all on the large size.

Smoke- 8/10  a minty, herbal, pine taste. Similar to the nose but less earth notes when smoking.

High- 8/10 good potency that leans into a more sedating/relaxed body high. Definitely increased my appetite. Could be used for day time or night time. 

Overall quality- 8/10 
Value- 8/10

This was rated as AAA and I feel like it is maybe just a few minor details off from AAAA. 
Had the potency been a little stronger I think it wouldâ€™ve hit that mark.",/r/MOMpics/comments/jg5tb5/blue_magoo_cookies_kootenay_botanicals_late_oct/,Thu Oct 22 18:49:22 2020 UTC

t3_jg4twa,/u/thechronickid_00,Super Lemon Haze Diamonds & Sauce - The Wholesome Monkey - October 2020,"A few more shots - https://imgur.com/a/v8kwyyr

A very nice colour and consistency to this Super Lemon Haze by Honeydip Extracts. Arriving in one juicy glob containing a multitude of micro diamonds that are swimming in sauce. Extremely easy to handle and scoop up as it's not runny and the sauce holds the diamonds to the dab tool like glue. A tiny bit got up into the plastic seal but it was very minimal and easily gathered.

The smell upon opening the lid was like actual lemon candy or a lemon head to be exact. Very sweet and citrusy and it tasted the exact same when dabbed. It dabbed clean and wasn't necessarily harsh but the vapour it produced was lung expanding and acrid which I've found before with haze strains. Still quite tasty and enjoyable at around 500 on the enail.

An extremely heady and hazy high that's felt right after the first dab. The energetic vibe it offers and tendency to be very talkative can't be ignored as it's super uplifting and social. Definitely sativa dominant in every way with very few physical traits other than a slight relaxation towards the end of the high.",/r/MOMpics/comments/jg4twa/super_lemon_haze_diamonds_sauce_the_wholesome/,Thu Oct 22 18:00:57 2020 UTC
t3_jg8jdl,/u/Dshe595,"Carly's Garden // Candy Land // Oct 2020","This is part of the 1 ounce special deal. The nugs are a bit small but the appeal on the nugs are beautiful, very covered in crystals. There's a bready smell to this one and a smooth hot sweet bread-like taste in the mouth. Good potency, good burn, good taste, good price. Shipped quick and my order came with free sunglasses, rollies, a metal grinder and some sick ass girly socks lol.

Very satisfied overall, the weed is great for the price but the whole bundle was amazing. Overall, I'd give this order 10/10. 

The sunglasses are too tight for my face though but it's a great gesture. The grinder is actually really nice quality but it can only fit about 1 joint worth of weed. Rollies aren't the greatest and tend to run a bit.",/r/MOMpics/comments/jg8jdl/carlys_garden_candy_land_oct_2020/,Thu Oct 22 21:02:17 2020 UTC

It's a thicker oil but taste great and has great CBD effects. The ACDC on the other hand(red) tasted too terpy and like cherries. Seemed to artificial. I personally didn't enjoy it as well as the Cannatonic.

t3_jg174u,/u/leafsin5,Strawberries Nâ€™ Cream - Primitive Exotics - Mid October,"The bag appeal of this one is off the charts. The outside of the nugs are completely caked with crystals and the inside isnt much different. The smell right out of the bag was crazy pungent with hints of pine and a sweet finish. It smoked smooth and the taste was very clean and finished with hints of citrus. the high was very social yet very strong, and made you just want to sit around the tv and shoot the shit with the fellas. Overall i give this bud a 9.68/10 as it very easily could be some of the nicest bud ive ever seen (with my own eyes) or smoked.

t3_jg1uew,/u/Garmacflip,Red Congo (smalls) HGA early October,"This stuff smells like lemon candy; beauty smell. Thereâ€™s a fair bit of leaf left on these but that was in the disclaimer. Had some popcorn but a lot of small buds too, the small buds being real dense and covered in trichomes. Smokes a tad dark cuz of the leaf but it doesnâ€™t affect the taste or buzz at all. These little nugs give a super daytime high with no burnout whatsoever. This has become one of my top daytime smokes very quickly. Love this stuff.

Upon first arrival I got hit with a great nose of pink Kush, followed up with more of a Piney smell so the nose is on point, bag of peels nice colors beautiful a little bit leafy but I don't mind that, I thought the buds could have been a little bigger and they came to little squished which is something to look into for HGA, Eazy fix tho.

This bud hit's hard smells great it's definitely a true quad and I would buy it again next time it comes on sale as I can afford $280 for a OZ, so I hunt for value and HGA get alot of my orders.",/r/MOMpics/comments/jg918u/pink_bubba_hga_oct_22/,Thu Oct 22 21:26:57 2020 UTC
t3_jg5t1i,/u/MCDaddy75,Do-Si-Dos (Private Reserve Collection) - Mailbox Marijuana - October,"Do-Si-Dos (Private Reserve Collection) from Mailbox Marijuana

Visual: This one was very nice looking as well! There were some bright greens and dark greens and some dark purple leaves. There was lots of sparkly crystal and it looked a bit dank. It was very dense but I could still squish it. It had a good moisture level. Â Â 

Nose: The nose was very piney and sweet with some gas to it.

Cut/Roll/Grind: I could feel the stickiness of it while cutting it. It was easy to bust up.

Taste: There was tons of flavour! There was lots of pine and gas and a spicy skunk to it.

Burn: The burn was great! It was nice and slow and steady.

Potency/Effects: Another amazing one! I got a big punch in my nose from this one and the potency built up fast and to a very good level for me. It had a great buzzy effect. I could definitely hang out on the couch with this Do-Si-Dos!

Overall score â€“ 9.7/10

t3_jg85nj,/u/Tempex6,Blue OG Sherbert - Tegridy Farms Cannabis - October Week 3,"First Impressions - Very very dense and styrofoam feel, I thought I got a half-ounce at first look but after weighing it is 28 grams, the photo of the buds is 7 grams alone. Super frosty, upon pulling it out of the bag trichromes fell off like snow. The smell is really nice, not going to compare it to real smells but it smells like a flower, a really nice and relaxing aroma, it doesn't have a skunk smell and it isn't so dank that it fills up your entire room with smell. The look of the bud is good but probably it's lowest trait, it's not brown but the red/orange hairs make it look a little brown, there are lots of sugar leaves that hug the bud really tightly (you can see in the pic) so they were worth leaving otherwise trimming would have taken off to much, still not the greatest thing though.  

Smoke - To be added.. btw this is a $120 ounce.. crazy good quality for the price, I think the only reason this isn't a higher price is how leafy it is.",/r/MOMpics/comments/jg85nj/blue_og_sherbert_tegridy_farms_cannabis_october/,Thu Oct 22 20:43:30 2020 UTC
